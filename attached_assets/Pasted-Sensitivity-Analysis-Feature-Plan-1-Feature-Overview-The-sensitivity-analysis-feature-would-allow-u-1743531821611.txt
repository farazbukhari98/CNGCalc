Sensitivity Analysis Feature Plan
1. Feature Overview
The sensitivity analysis feature would allow users to see how changes in key variables affect their financial outcomes without having to manually change each input value. This provides a more dynamic understanding of which factors most significantly impact the ROI and payback period.
2. Key Variables to Include
Based on the CNG Fleet Calculator's functionality, these variables would be most valuable for sensitivity analysis:
Fuel Prices
Gasoline price ($/gallon)
Diesel price ($/gallon)
CNG price ($/GGE)
Vehicle Parameters
Vehicle acquisition costs
Annual miles driven
Fuel efficiency (MPG)
Maintenance costs
Operational Parameters
Station type and costs
Time horizon (analysis period)
3. User Interface Design
Main Sensitivity Panel
A dedicated "Sensitivity Analysis" tab or expandable section in the main interface
Introduction text explaining the purpose and how to use the feature
Variable Selection
Dropdown menu allowing users to select which variable they want to analyze
Option to analyze multiple variables simultaneously for advanced users
Range Controls
For each selected variable, provide a slider with:
Minimum value (e.g., -30% of current value)
Maximum value (e.g., +30% of current value)
Current value clearly marked
Incremental steps (e.g., 5% changes)
Results Display
Real-time updating graph showing how the selected variable affects:
Payback period (primary y-axis)
ROI percentage (secondary y-axis)
Net savings over the analysis period (tertiary y-axis or separate graph)
X-axis would represent the range of the variable being analyzed
Threshold Indicators
Visual markers showing critical thresholds:
Break-even point (where payback period equals analysis period)
Target ROI thresholds (e.g., 10%, 15%, 20%)
Current value position
4. Interaction Flow
User selects "Sensitivity Analysis" from the main navigation
System pre-populates current values from the main calculator
User selects which variable(s) to analyze
System generates initial sensitivity graph
User can:
Move sliders to see different ranges
Toggle between different result metrics (payback, ROI, net savings)
Add or remove variables from analysis
Export or save the analysis
5. Advanced Features
Multi-Variable Analysis
2D heat map showing how two variables interact (e.g., fuel price vs. miles driven)
Color gradient representing payback period or ROI
Scenario Comparison
Ability to save specific points on the sensitivity curve as named scenarios
Side-by-side comparison of these scenarios
Critical Value Calculation
Automatically calculate and highlight the "critical value" where the project becomes financially viable (e.g., minimum CNG-diesel price differential needed)
Probability Weighting
Allow users to assign probability distributions to variables (e.g., fuel prices)
Generate Monte Carlo simulation results showing probability of different outcomes
6. Implementation Approach
Phase 1: Basic Sensitivity Analysis
Single variable analysis with sliders
Real-time updating line graph
Focus on the three most impactful variables: fuel prices, vehicle costs, and annual miles
Phase 2: Enhanced Visualization
Multi-variable analysis
Threshold indicators
Scenario saving and comparison
Phase 3: Advanced Analysis
Probability weighting
Monte Carlo simulations
Export and reporting features
7. User Experience Considerations
Ensure real-time updates are smooth and responsive
Provide clear visual cues when values change
Include help text explaining how to interpret results
Use consistent color coding across all visualizations
Ensure mobile compatibility with touch-friendly controls
